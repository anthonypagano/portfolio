        <section class="about">
            <p class="middle">I was the kid growing up who always took apart his toys to see how they worked. This facinaton continued after I received my first computer as a gift in 1995. From there I began creating the most basic of web pages and haven't looked back since. In my professional experience I've spent a lot of time on the front end working with html, css, and javascript and all the nuances of browser and email client support. I actually started out on the backend writing SQL reports on a Unix based database. Most recently I worked for an event marketplace that supported a handfull of internal and external apps that were written in several languages including Classic ASP, VB.Net, C#, and React. At the end of 2018 however I decided it was time to head back to school and add to my skillset where I graduated from Thinkful's Full Stack Flex bootcamp and added Node and React to my skills portfolio.</p>
